 First: the region is important
 Managed Instance accepts creation of instances based on its Compute + Storage in different region.


Line 1-10 A data block for the subnet to be used for the sqlmi.
Are we creating the SQLMI from scratch?
 The question is posed because the network connectivity is unique for sqlmi
 NB: To create a VNET-joined Managed Instance, the instance and the virtual network have to be located in the same region
Note: The subnet should  meet the network Connectivity requirements for sqlmi: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/connectivity-architecture-overview?view=azuresql#network-requirements



Line 14-17: A resource block for a random password creation for the admin password. There is also a policy for password for sqlmi. There are different ways password can be managed e.g key vault

Line 21-44: The sqlmi resource block will run if the sqlmi name "existing" attribute is set to false



Line 48-64: Here, the data blocks are to rextract existing sqlmi. These are done because if Geo-replication is needed.
Question: Is it needed?
If yes, there have to be existing msqlmi to set it up. This will eventually create a failover group(68-84)



Security setting:
Line 81-107: A key vault is needed to achieve this so there is a data block to extract an existing key vault.
soft delete and purge needs to be enabled on the key vault for transparent data encryption.

Next, storage account is needed for
